Title: MusicMeals

Problem Statement: Our mission is to match what people eat with what music they
listen to while eating that particular food so they can enjoy a hearty meal 
with their favorite tunes. 

Solution: We will sample data of users who use our project and store the data
of what food they are eating and what they think of the music that is being 
played while they are eating that particular food. Each user will then upvote
or downvote the song, and with this information, we will be able to categorize
which songs people like listening to while eating certain kinds of food.

Features: We will have a music player that will play a random song and also a
form underneath which will allow the user to type in what food they are eating
while listening to the music player. As they're listening to a song, the player
will allow them to like or dislike a song. If they like it, it is recorded and 
The songs keeps playing. If they don't like it the player skips to the next song 
and records the fact that they did not like it. 

Data we will collect: We will store two items for each iteration our webpage
goes through. One being the food they are eating, and the second being the 
answer to the question as to whether or not they enjoyed the music they were
listening to with their meal. Using the response of whether they enjoyed the
music or not, we will then match up that song with that food(s) for future 
users.

APIs Used: iTunes API

Algorithms Used: Algorithm to select a playlist based on the type of food the 
user is eating.

* Your file names can be better.  The hell is there is "...copy..."?
* Food + music?  Sure, go for it!
* There's actually an iTunes API?
* But what about the food?  Won't you need to get data about food somewhere?
