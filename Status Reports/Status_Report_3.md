This week we were able to get most of the Database component of the project 
done as well as set up the like and dislike features. We figured out a few 
structural flaws and changed out plans so that the code is more simple and 
better to write. We feel that we are coming down the home stretch as we can 
see this idea really start to come to fruition. Now that we are working on all 
of the components and we have a nice design all that needs to be done is to 
finish up and get everything to work.
